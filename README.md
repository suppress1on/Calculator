# Calculator

I am currently learning the Python programming language. I wrote this program to master the basics of the language. At the moment, this is a simple calculator in Python. In this program, I tried to fit all my knowledge of the basics of the language, but in such a way as not to leave the subject area of the project.
I continue to develop and further my projects will become more and more difficult.

The calculator came out minimalistic. It has a function that generates the result of operations on numbers entered by the user. There are error handling (wrong input, checking the list for content). The program can both clear the entire history and sort its contents in ascending order. There is a program menu.
